Exita is a data export tool that functions like an OCR application 
but for a specific character set.

REQUIREMENTS
* Python >= 2.7
* Libs: PIL, progressbar

INSTALLATION
* Untar/unzip into directory and run exita.py


HOW: Exita reads in an image and breaks it apart into cells based on 
the height and width of the character set bitmap used (e.g. cp437-8×12). 
With each cell in an image, it tries to find a match and return the 
proper text character.

NOTICE: Some character sets like cp437 have dual-use characters that 
have a glyph when printed but are also used as control characters. 
These are handled by the “special characters” module which can be 
extended to support more character sets.
